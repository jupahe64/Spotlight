# Spotlight - Super Mario 3D World Editor

Spotlight is the latest (and best) Editor for Super Mario 3D World on the Nintendo Wii U.<br/>
It has a boatload of features allowing you to make your very own levels, toad houses, mystery boxes, and more!

## System Requirements

- OpenGL 3.0+
- Windows 8+

## Assistance and How to Use

A full guide to Spotlight can be found on the [Spotlight Wiki](https://github.com/jupahe64/Spotlight/wiki).

## Compiling from Source

To compile Spotlight you will need to download it to a folder also containing the <a href="https://github.com/jupahe64/GL_EditorFramework">GL_EditorFramework</a><br/> repository.
The folder layout should look like this:<br/>

<br/>
These folders must contain their respective project repositories.
(make sure to get rid of the -master in the end when downloading both)<br/>
After that it should be ready to go.
